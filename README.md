# Intercom Message Assignment

## Goals

    This extension was started the same day that Intercom launched it's official support for message assignment so don't blame me if it's unfinished, undocumented or even if there are no tests cause I did even take care of that :S
    My intention was to create a realtime flag for messages opened by other support team members. When a message is flag, an alert will appear at messages index and in show itself.

## Done till now

    Well, flagged messages comes from a hardcoded json, not even an API done with Rails/Sinatra and messages are still not flagged when a support member access it. So this extension was really on an early stage, but WTH I learned how to start a extension if I ever need to make one :D

## So

    I'll probably would finish this extension cause so I'll be updating it once a while. Cya!
